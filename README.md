# Agile2020-SocialMedia-WalkingRoutes

Published materials for submitted paper Agile 2020

GENERAL
This study is investigating on computing walking routes based on 
crowdsourced geotagged social media from Flikcr database. We aim to distinguish
and classify between different groups of contirbutours of Flickr data. E.g.: tourism
oriented photographers and local photographers. We are generating a unique methodolgoy
of compute adaptive spatiotemporal descriptors to classify between groups of contirbutors.
Using grid cell clustering we have generated populariy socre matrix based on accumulated
number of each contributors group.
Aforementioned, we have implemented walking route compuataion using Orienteering problem appproach
and used the score populariy matrix for computed weighted route.

This research presents the use of socail media for developing context-aware walking routes
adjusted to user's interest. The classification between tourists and locals allow
to decide how to trade the one off against the other.
